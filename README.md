# Tip calculator app

![Design preview for the Tip calculator app](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this repo.

**To do this project, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The Project

This Project's challenge is to build out this tip calculator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

## Where to find everything

The target is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
